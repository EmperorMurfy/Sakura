# Sakura - Custom Discord Bot
Written using Java Script. Very basic discord bot to experiment, test, & learn discord bots as a whole. This bot currently is designed to be ran in Visual Studio Code with node.js [Current version using v20.11.1]
Has very basic functions, works with one server at a time at the moment. 

## Current Functions
* Slash commands - try /hey 
* Custom bot status - 'Fying pan asmr' in desc
* Checks for message events and responds - type 'domain expansion'
* Cont from above - can check for user ID and self detection

## Future Goals
* Multiple commands

* Jujutsu Kaisen interactions & events
* minigames? JJK themed?
* add previously coded java games that work in console into chat?
* add multi-server support
